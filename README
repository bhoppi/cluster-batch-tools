In a cluster, on each node many programs, configurations and so on, are the same.

On the other hand, lots of routine tasks on cluster need do same work on each node.

In order not to do this kind of task repeatedly, the cluster-batch-tools is a solution, which let you just perform it once as if you do on a single computer, but affect the whole cluster.

This small project contains some scripts:

    cl-cp.sh:                 cp a specified local file to each node
    cl-exec.sh:               execute a specified command/script, auto on each node
    cp-eachnode.exp:          scp's wrapper for auto copy file without interact
    run-eachnode.exp:         ssh's wrapper for auto exec cmd without interact
    run-eachnode-async.exp:   ssh's wrapper for auto exec cmd without interact, background mode
    nodelist:                 file contains every node address of a cluster

It has below dependencies to work: openssh, expect, bash or alike

Hope it can help you :)
