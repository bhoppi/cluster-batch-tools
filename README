In a cluster, programs and configurations are often the same with each other on every node.
On the other hand, lots of routine tasks on cluster need do same operations on each node.
So Cluster-Batch-Tools is a solution, which let you just perform it once as if you do on a single computer, but affect the whole cluster.

This small project contains some scripts:
    cl-cp.sh:                 cp a specified local file to each node
    cl-exec.sh:               execute a specified command/script, auto on each node
    (to be added)
    
There are also some expect scripts used by above scripts. Usually you need not use them directly.
    cp-eachnode.exp:          scp's wrapper for auto copy file without interact
    run-eachnode.exp:         ssh's wrapper for auto exec cmd without interact
    run-eachnode-async.exp:   ssh's wrapper for auto exec cmd without interact, background mode
    
And there also has a nodelist file, you can edit it as need.

It has below dependencies to work: openssh, expect, bash(or other compatible shell)

Hope it can help you :)
